# Example SASS Watch Commands
`
sass --watch html-els/buttons/styles/scss/:html-els/buttons/styles/css/ --style compressed
`

This will take from the associated directly, then automatically compress the text as expected.

# NOTES
- maybe should ignore the css directories in commits, but for now I think not.
